`git clone https://github.com/kyleboehlen/go-exercism.git && cd go-exercism && cp .env.example .env`
Set your [Token](https://exercism.org/settings/api_cli) in the .env file
`./up.sh`
Now you're good to go with the first Exercism exercise, [Hello, World](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/hello-world)
Be sure to read the help.md and readme.md once you pull the exercise down.
Hint: `go test` is how you run your tests after modifying your code.
Check out [Working Locally](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally) for more details on working locally; your api token should already be configured by the docker startup script, but it goes over donwloading and submitting your solutions as well as other CLI functionality.
